# platforms-in-planet

A simple project demonstrating a simulator with planets, platforms, and a timekeeper.

## Objects
- `Planet` – represents a generic moving planet in space.
- `Earth` – a specialized `Planet` with a spherical surface model.
- `Platform` – a platform that can be attached to a planet.
- `Time` – keeps track of simulation time.

These are defined in the `objects` package.
